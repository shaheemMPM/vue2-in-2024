# Vue 2 in 2024

By the time of creating this project, Vue 2 has reached EOL, for more refer the [official guide](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

## How to scaffold the starter kit

Install [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) globally with NPM
```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli
```

Create new vue project. Here pick the vue2 starter template from the given options
```bash
vue create <app_name>
```

## Project setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```bash
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Caution
- While installing some of the third party packages I had to use older version to not have any conflicts.
eg: installation of vee-validate
```
npm i vee-validate@2.0.3
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
